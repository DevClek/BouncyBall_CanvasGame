# BouncyBall_CanvasGame
A random old project I made a while back


**GAME OBJECTIVE**
  - In this game you are able to move a padding horizontally and the purpose is to hit all the balls that appear. But, some of the balls may actually make you lose the game. 
  - This project was made a while ago while I was still working on html canvas games.
